/**
 * 希望在销毁时释放资源的bean实现的接口。
 * Interface to be implemented by beans that want to release resources on destruction-销毁.
 * A {@link BeanFactory} will invoke the destroy method on individual-个体 destruction of a
 * scoped bean. An {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext} is supposed
 * to dispose all of its singletons on shutdown, driven by the application lifecycle.
 *
 * <p>A Spring-managed bean may also implement Java's {@link AutoCloseable} interface
 * for the same purpose-目的. An alternative-替代的选择 to implementing an interface is specifying-指明 a
 * custom-定制 destroy method, for example in an XML bean definition. For a list of all
 * bean lifecycle methods, see the {@link BeanFactory BeanFactory javadocs}.
